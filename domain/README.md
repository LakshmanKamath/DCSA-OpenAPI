# DCSA defined Domains
Domains are used to specify reusable components used accross APIs.
Domains are stored with the version number as part of the filename as multiple versions of the same Domain can be active in different APIs/Domains at the same time. Once a Domain is published in a specific version - that file never changes. If changes are required - a new version of the Domain needs to be created.
