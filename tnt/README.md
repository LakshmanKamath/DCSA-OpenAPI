The DCSA Interface Standard for Track and Trace is documented on the [**DCSA TNT**](https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis/dcsaorg/DCSA_TNT) SwaggerHub.

The purpose of an Event Hub is to send events and manage subscriptions. Track & Trace is a specialised Hub managing: `TransportEvents`, `EquipmentEvents` and `ShipmentEvents`. It is only possible to receive `TransportEvents`, `EquipmentEvents` and `ShipmentEvents` and subscribe to `TransportEvents`, `EquipmentEvents` and `ShipmentEvents` when implementing Track & Trace.
