# DCSA – Digital Container Shipping Association

### About DCSA
DCSA envisions a digitally interconnected container shipping industry. Our mission is to be the de facto standards body for the industry, setting the technological foundation for interoperable IT solutions. Together with our member carriers, DCSA creates vendor-neutral, technology-agnostic standards for IT and non-competitive business practices. By working towards the widespread adoption of these standards, our aim is to move the industry forward in terms of customer experience, efficiency, collaboration, innovation and respect for the environment.
### The objective of DCSA
Data and Interface Standard project workstream is to strengthen the container shipping industry’s ability to send and receive data across all parties in the industry. Furthermore, it aims at to enhance inter-carrier cooperation based on shared requirements and to ensure interoperability by using a shared data language.
